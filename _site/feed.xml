        <title>Why You Should Use Twitter, and How Not To Go Insane in the Process</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What if there was a place where people with the same interests as you hang out and talk about the things which you are so passionate about? What if there was a place on the Internet where you had free and easy access to the most insightful writers, the smartest researchers, and the most talented artists from all over the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This place exists. It’s called Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://lettucebecereal.substack.com/embed&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; style=&quot;border:0px solid #EEE; background:fffff8;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is better known for having wrecked our chances of ever getting flying cars and for destroying democracy, but those who focus on such tired talking points miss the point of what makes Twitter such a unique place. In the old days, communities were built around message boards. If you liked video games, you had to go to one such message board if you wanted to talk with people who liked games as much as you did. But these message boards were insular. Each community was built around a single topic, which meant your many interests could only be satisfied by visiting different message boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this posed a problem. How were you to find the place where ‘your people’ hung out? Suppose you had taken an interest in blacksmithing. Where do all the blacksmiths hang out? How are  you supposed to find that out? The cost to finding these communities was immense. 
You were shut off from like minded people simply because you did not know where they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is what you’d get if you were to put together into a single place all the world’s message boards and decided to limit each post to 280 characters. It is a community of communities - a metacommunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where before these communities existed insulated from one another, each in their own secluded corner of the internet, now they are jumbled together on Twitter, where millions of people from all over the world are brought together into a single place where they can talk about their passions and interests with many others like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this immense mass of people that makes Twitter special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, I have access to hundreds of people who are as excited about the same things I am. I get to watch conversations between economists discussing the latest happenings, psychologists talking about the latest findings. I get to learn about how technology leaders think about the world, and the future they are trying to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call it my learning engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Twitter the rate at which I learn goes into overdrive. It is like having a personal research team without having to pay for it. I get exposed to things that I would never otherwise get exposed to, things that materially change my life as they open up new gates through which I can satisfy the rabbit hole of my curiosity. And it never stops. The first thing I do when I wake up, after my morning coffee, is browse what my research team has been working on while I was asleep. Every day there’s new things to read, new things to take a look at. Twitter is what God would have created if he was designing a paradise for the infovores of the world, except Jack Dorsey got there first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a magical place. Investing your time and effort to make sure you are using it properly is one of the highest return things you could be doing. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://andymatuschak.org/&quot;&gt;Andy Matuschak&lt;/a&gt; put it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perell.com/podcast/andy-matuschak&quot;&gt;The North Star podcast&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Twitter is this magical place where if you manage to follow the right people, tune your settings just right, and have the right stance, it will help you think better.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why everyone should use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be tough for those on the outside to fire up a Twitter account and understand what it is that makes it worth their time. The very idea of following people so that you can read what they write in 280-character chunks seems dumb. It certainly doesn’t look like any other social media platform, and there’s a sizable gap between when one starts using it and getting enough of an understanding to use it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;marginnote 4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt; ⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;marginnote 4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Note that my focus here is not to give you advice on how to use Twitter as a participant, something that I do not have much experience with. In message board parlance, when it comes to Twitter, I am mostly a lurker. &lt;/span&gt;Which is why I am writing this. I want to get more people to use Twitter, and those who already do so to use it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any proper use of Twitter starts with this fundamental principle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are the one in control over who has permission to put things in front of you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting ads to the side, the only tweets that you see are the ones the people you follow put there. (sidebar: Retweets are tweets from other people that someone you follow chose to put in front of you) And that simple fact is what will determine how much value you get from Twitter. Curating the list of people you follow, following the right people, is what will make or break your Twitter experience. If your timeline is filled with junk, then you might as well don’t use it, but if you are careful in choosing who to follow the payoff is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the main action is in who you follow, the question beckons: Whom should you follow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow interesting people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How that principle caches out in concrete terms is up to you. Interesting people come in all shapes and sizes. What is interesting to me may not be so to you. What matters is that you follow the most consistently interesting people you find. How do you recognize them? They are the ones sharing interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could be experts in niche academic areas sharing the latest research, or obscure bloggers spinning flimsy theories that purport to explain how society AcTuAlLy works. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that if you find what they share interesting, you follow them. Follow enough of these interesting people and you will have created a place on the Internet that has been specifically tailored for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the more you use Twitter, the more to your liking it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more interesting people you follow, the more interesting things you will be exposed to. Some of these interesting things will be interesting people. Follow these people. They too will share interesting things, some of which will, again, be interesting people. And away the flywheel goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been written on how social media is the bane of all evil. Now I wonder if this isn’t because they never learned how to use Twitter properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following interesting people is a good first step in that direction, but some hygiene is required to make sure that Twitter brings value to your life rather than detracting from it. It’s easy to lose your sanity in the chaos of the Twitterverse. The following is a list of rules that you should follow if you want to keep your wits about you, and in so doing experience Twitter at its best, a place that catalyzes growth by connecting you to the smartest and most interesting people the world has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-not-follow-people-who-waste-their-time-on-politics&quot;&gt;Do not follow people who waste their time on politics.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics is the mind-killer, and in few places is this more visible than on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not follow people who use Twitter as another avenue through which they fight their political battles. The gladiatorial arena that is political warfare brings the worst out of people, and Twitter elevates these tendencies up to eleven. Not only does it bring together people with the same ideologies, it does so for their perceived mortal enemies as well. Like two planets orbiting each other, eventually they will collide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people are not interesting. Quite the contrary, people whose identity is tied to politics are boring beyond belief. No matter what happens, you know what they think about it. They do not add value to your timeline, they detract from it by polluting it with political talking points about the latest manufactured controversy or the latest crime against humanity that &lt;em&gt;insert ideological opponent&lt;/em&gt; committed. Do not follow these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-not-follow-news-sites&quot;&gt;Do not follow news sites.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s little reason to follow the Twitter accounts of news websites. This goes beyond the first rule, though it also follows from it. Recall what we discussed about you being the one in control over who gets permission to put things in your timeline. The point of following interesting people is that their interesting-ness acts as a filter over what gets shown to you. That filter is what makes Twitter so valuable. It separates the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News websites lack that filter. By following their Twitter accounts you will be permitting a bot, or worse, a social media intern, to put things in front of you whose only merit is that they were published by that website. If you think you should follow them to keep tabs on what’s happening around the world, note that if it was truly important the people you follow would already be talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as people doubt whether a tree has fallen if no one was there to hear it, then has something truly happened if your Twitter feed is not talking about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule applies to following journalists as well. Journalists are by and large boring people, so by the principle of only following interesting people they should be denied entrance into your timeline. To make things worse, they also make their living by participating in the trenches of political warfare, so by the first rule they should also be denied entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finance journalists tend to be better than most though. Make that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unfollow-people-that-trigger-you&quot;&gt;Unfollow people that trigger you.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nntaleb&quot;&gt;Nassim Taleb&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most important intellectual figures of our age. He is also a massive asshole on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave the self-flagellation for another place and another time. When you’re on Twitter, focus on the happiness and excitement that having access to hundreds of interesting people brings you. That means cutting off from your timeline those with the uncanny ability to annoy you. Your timeline is a magical place, a place of learning and excitement. Try to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter what it is that they do that annoys you. I was tired of watching Nassim go off on one of his tired tirades about how this person is a charlatan, or that person doesn’t deadlift, or whichever spasmodic script that’s become so characteristic of him he was performing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I stopped following him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-the-mute-function-liberally&quot;&gt;Use the mute function liberally.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re talking about maintaining an equanimous mind, Twitter allows you to set up a list of words and phrases that you do not want to appear in your feed. I don’t think the value of this feature needs much explaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who’s been on Twitter for a while has noticed how, from time to time, a rift in the fabric of time and space appears and sucks onto itself the mental energy of everyone. As if a master switch has been flipped, people turn into hungry zombies who’ve spotted a fresh brain served on a silver platter. They can’t stop themselves from shambling towards it, their ravenous instincts overwhelming their mind. The current President of the United States has an uncanny ability to create these rifts. He says something, often stupid, and then everyone is talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mute function acts like a shield against this. Just add “Trump” to it and poof, you’ll never see it written in your timeline ever again. Continue adding words and phrases to this list as these rifts appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-lists-to-separate-your-interests-from-each-other&quot;&gt;Make lists to separate your interests from each other.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting people often have lots of interests. Some of them do not overlap neatly. I am sure you identify with this dilemma (you are an interesting person, are you not?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a bit weary of promoting this advice since Twitter’s interface for handling lists is a monumental piece of flaming hot garbage, but separating the accounts you follow into different lists based on why you follow them can help make your experience smoother and more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;marginnote 2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt; ⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;marginnote 2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;It also allows you to cleave off entire communities from your life when you deem them unworthy of your time. This happened to me after the 2016 US Presidential election, which destroyed the minds of many fantasy and science fiction authors I enjoyed following. Thankfully, I had siloed off that community into a separate list which I have since then not opened. &lt;/span&gt; Videogames have held my interest since I was a little kid playing Red Alert 2 on my father’s computer, and from then on I have followed the industry with interest.  Game developers marry the technical, the pragmatic, and the artistic in a way that is appealing to me. However, the videogame Twitter scene has a different vibe from the economists, techies, and weirdos that I follow on my main Twitter feed. Siloing them off into different lists allows me to keep tabs on what these communities are talking about and sharing without suffering from much whiplash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-periodic-breaks&quot;&gt;Take periodic breaks.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that social media websites devote considerable resources to hacking away your attention from under you is now common knowledge. Twitter is as guilty of that as any other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re scrolling through your timeline when a bright blue popup appears to tell you that there are new tweets for you to read. You refresh the page, scroll over those, and again the blue popup appears, resetting the cycle. The notification’s icon is shining red, beckoning you to open it. Did someone like your tweet? Is someone mad with something you tweeted? You had planned to do something else, but you can’t help yourself. You need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These design choices, made to get you to continually use the website, are further compounded by the investment you’re putting in by curating your feed. The whole point is to make Twitter more valuable to you, so it’s no wonder that you start spending more time on it. It’s hard not to. Everything else seems so boring in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time passes, it becomes harder not to become embroiled with the idiosyncratic expectations and rules of Twitter. It’s not that we forget there’s a world outside of it, it’s that we mistake it for the world. Because it’s all we see, we think it’s all there is. The latest storm to take over Twitter is confused for something that people, real people, flesh and blood people, actually care about. The truth of the matter is that very few of them know anything about what goes on there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;marginnote 3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt; ⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;marginnote 3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;The only person I know close to me who also is a heavy user of Twitter is my mother, and she’s a shitposter. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By taking periodic breaks from Twitter you’ll be reminded of that, and when you return you will do so with clearer eyes that are better able to separate what matters from what doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;once-in-a-while-purge&quot;&gt;Once in a while, purge.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curation is a lossy process. Your attempt at only allowing interesting people into your timeline will not be perfect. Some people will turn out to be, well, boring. Some will actively pollute your feed with things you dislike (see previous rule on not following people that trigger you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of curating your Twitter feed is being on the lookout for these bad apples and rooting them out. And even in this you will not be entirely successful. It’s easy to unfollow someone who turns out to be a deeply racist and misogynistic alt-right troll, but most people are not that egregious in their unpleasantness. Most people don’t call that much attention onto themselves. They’re boring, sure, but they’re boring in a way that you just scroll by their tweets without noticing they’re there. These people might have passed some initial filter which made you follow them, but since then they’ve added little value to your Twitter experience. It’s not that they are fundamentally uninteresting people, it’s just that they’re uninteresting to you. You keep following them because they’ve never given you a reason to actively put in the effort of unfollowing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;marginnote 4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt; ⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;marginnote 4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;It might be weird to think of it as something I have to do, but remember that I am trying to turn Twitter into something that I value a lot and going through my tweets is how I extract that value &lt;/span&gt; I don’t presume to know what’s the limit on the number of people you should follow on Twitter. At the time of this writing I follow 629 accounts and sometimes find myself overwhelmed with the amount of tweets I have to go through.  Whatever the number, over time you will accumulate leeches whose tweets suck away the vitality of your feed. Think of purging the people you follow as picking weeds. You want your garden to grow into its full, lush, potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open up the list of accounts you’re following, and for each one ask yourself whether it has proven itself worthy of the permission to put things in your timeline that you’ve given it. You do not need to be sanguine about it. You can give people second chances. But going on a purge once in a while is a way to remind yourself that your permission is conditional, not absolute. And as you giveth away, you can also taketh away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-rule---do-not-contribute-to-the-shit-flinging&quot;&gt;Bonus rule - Do not contribute to the shit flinging.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows that the Internet can be an unpleasant place. The point of many of the previous rules is to create a personal bubble where everything’s sunshine and unicorns and where the demons are kept at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite your best efforts, you will nevertheless come face to face with some of the worst things that the Internet encourages. Someone will say something, and the faceless mob will mercilessly pile on it. They will throw bombs behind the safety of a screen, forgetting that on the other side there’s someone else, a person just as them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be tempted to contribute your fair share of that. Try not to. There’s enough shit being thrown around for you to add yours to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you read something that angers the very core of your soul (remember not to follow people who trigger you!), keep the words of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations&quot;&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt; in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on the positive aspects of Twitter, the people who use it to share their interests, to talk about what’s on their mind. Watch, as countless communities spontaneously emerge to bring together people from all over the world over their love for something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on what makes Twitter an interesting place, a place like no other on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Read (Almost) All Scientific Papers for Free</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Learning is exhilarating, and science is one of the greatest accomplishments of modern civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these are not terribly exciting points to make, it is curious how much of a barrier there is between the public and the scientific papers which are the products of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or rather, how much of a barrier there was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever obstacles there were in place, the Internet has burned them to the ground and fundamentally changed the informational inequalities that the old system promoted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://lettucebecereal.substack.com/embed&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; style=&quot;border:0px solid #EEE; background:fffff8;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, if you were not a researcher or a student, there was no way for you to read scientific papers. For all the lip service payed to science and having a scientific mindset, people have not had until recently the opportunity to see for themselves what it is that scientists actually do. The relationship between the public and science has always been mediated by the media and whatever popularizing activites scientists make, either through general audience books or lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the way that the system was structured, there was what could be called a state of informational inequality, whereby a select few have access to the repositories of the world’s scientific knowledge while the large majority of people did not and had to contend themselves with whatever morsels they were fed by the gatekeepers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, that inequality is no longer in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the same incentives that created it are still with us, they can no longer put up much of a fight against the curious mind. Anyone who wishes to read the latest scientific results, or the classics that have defined a field, can now do so. The ideas and insights from some of the brightest minds in the world about everything under the sun are now accessible to everyone with a curious mind and a connection to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth of the matter is, we have it good these days. If there is any paper we want to read we can do so with no trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone with access to the Internet has free, immediate access to virtually every piece of scientific research that has ever been published. The only issue is that most people, even academics by my experience, have no idea that this is true. They have not been made aware that times have changed and that the gates have been blown wide open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I want to show you how to take advantage of this new paradigm so that your curious mind is never again prevented from filling itself with the sweet pleasures of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the torrents of knowledge flow freely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sci-hub&quot;&gt;Sci-Hub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is somewhat anticlimactic to note that this post can be boiled down to two words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use Sci-Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sci-Hub has been the greatest influencing force towards a world of informational equality. Started in 2011 by Alexandra Elbakyan, a Kazakhstani programmer, the goal behind Sci-Hub is to make information available to all those who wish to access it. To do that, it uses the user accounts of supporting researchers to get inside the networks of universities around the world to download papers that  it then makes available for anyone to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s true that information wants to be free, then it has found a powerful ally in Sci-hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a paper you want to read it is very unlikely you won’t be able to find it with Sci-Hub. &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/32822&quot;&gt;An analysis from 2018&lt;/a&gt; studied how the repository amassed by Sci-Hub until 2017 stacked up against the access provided by the University of Pennsylvania and concluded that Sci-Hub provided a much greater coverage, containing approximately 70% of the 81.6 million scholarly articles that are registered with Crossref. Things can only have gotten better since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sci-Hub is so good that researchers worldwide, the very people who are supposed to be the ones with the exclusive access to the research literature, use it regularly because it is that much better than what their university provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if Sci-Hub is so good, how do you go about using it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the website:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -&lt;/strong&gt; Copy the URL of the paper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 -&lt;/strong&gt; Go to www.sci-hub.se&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 -&lt;/strong&gt; Paste it there and have fun learning about the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that simple. And it can be even simpler by creating a bookmarklet in your browser that automates the entire process. To create one, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a bookmarklet in Firefox:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -&lt;/strong&gt; Right-click on the bookmarks toolbar and choose “New Bookmark”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 -&lt;/strong&gt; In the Location prompt copy-paste the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;javascript:location.href%20=%20location.origin.replace(/^https/,%20’http’)%20+%20’.sci-hub.se’%20+%20location.pathname%20+%20location.search&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 -&lt;/strong&gt; Save it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a bookmarklet in Chrome:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -&lt;/strong&gt; Right-click on the bookmarks toolbar and choose “New Page”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 -&lt;/strong&gt; In the URL prompt, copy-paste the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;javascript:location.href%20=%20location.origin.replace(/^https/,%20’http’)%20+%20’.sci-hub.se’%20+%20location.pathname%20+%20location.search&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 -&lt;/strong&gt; Save it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this bookmarklet does is replace the URL of the page you are in (which would be the page of the paper you want to read) with the the Sci-Hub version of it. Instead of having to copy the URL, travel to the Sci-Hub page, and paste it there, this bookmarklet does all of that automatically. You just click on the bookmark and it will take you there&lt;label for=&quot;sci-hub.tw&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sci-hub.tw&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;If for some reason the website is blocked, substitute where it is written ‘sci-hub.se’ with ‘sci-hub.tw’ &lt;/span&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For almost any paper, Sci-hub will be enough. The remaining tips I have will help if by an unlucky draw of the cards the paper you want to read is one of the few that Sci-Hub does not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sci-Hub is liberating. In the Greek mythos, Prometheus stole the fire from the gods and gifted it to humans. Sci-Hub is that Promethean enterprise, setting knowledge free from the shackles it has been bound to. To say that Sci-Hub is one of the things in this world I value the most is an understatement. My life would be irrevocably poorer without its existence, and if you are only now discovering it, I am sure that you will in no time agree with me when I say that this website, created by an unassuming Kazakhstani programmer, is one of the gems of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just hope that Alexandra doesn’t end up &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1773765/sci-hub-creator-says-shes-not-working-for-russian-intelligence/&quot;&gt;sharing Prometheus’ rotten fate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-scholar&quot;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Scholar is for papers what Google is for the Internet at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can search papers by title or author, and specify what time period you want the papers to have been published in. You can also enter keywords related to things you are looking for to see if there have been papers published about it. For example, you can search for “episodic memory in animals” at it will show you papers in which those keywords appear. The traditional tips on how to use Google apply here, so using quote markers around a phrase will search for that verbatim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Google Scholar does that is relevant for our purposes here is that if in its process of aggregating websites it finds the PDF of paper available, it will include a link to it in the search results. The selection is not as comprehensive as Sci-Hub, but because Google Scholar is often used in an exploratory fashion when we know what we want to look for but are not entirely sure which papers to read, having those links right at hand is often valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Google Scholar doesn’t link to the PDF of the paper you want, you can try searching for it in the regular Google website. Sometimes it might happen that even though the paper is available online, it does not get indexed as such by Google Scholar. In such cases you’re more likely to be able to find it if you get creative with your use of Google by, for example, searching for specific phrases that you know appear in the text. For example, if a paper includes a quote from another paper that you can’t find, searching for that quote might turn up the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once found the PDF of an unpublished paper I wanted to read by searching for combinations of the authors’ names and keywords that I thought would appear on the title. That turned up the schedule for a conference the authors were presenting the paper in, which included a Google Drive link to a copy of the paper in it. A little bit of intuition and creativity go a long way here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, one Google Scholar feature that I rarely see people talk about is how you can create alerts for when a paper you enjoyed gets cited by another paper, or an author you like publishes something new. Though the signal to noise ratio can be low, it is a cheap way to introduce some serendipity into your reading process and may point you to things that you wouldn’t otherwise find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;asking-people-for-help&quot;&gt;Asking people for help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the paper you are looking for isn’t on Sci-Hub, and Google doesn’t turn up anything, the next best avenue to pursue is asking other people if they have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might mean asking one of the authors of the paper for a copy, or at the very least seeing if they have one available through their website. Researchers generally do a lousy job keeping their personal websites up to date, but it can’t hurt to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also not every day that a researcher gets a cold email from someone they’ve never met asking for something that they wrote with the expectation that it would only ever be read by the small community of other researchers working on that topic, so you are unlikely to bother them by doing so. Note that this is nothing like asking for an author to send you a copy of his or her book for free. Researchers make no money from published research, even if publishers charge people to access that research, so unless you’re terribly unpleasant in your email, you are more likely to make the researcher just a little bit happier in knowing that someone is interested in their research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If what you’re searching for is from a long time ago and on a particularly obscure topic, then it might be difficult to get the previous strategies to work. For those special cases, as a measure of last resort, you might try sending a distress call into the void of the Internet and wait to see if a kind soul answers your beacon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One place you might try is the r/scholar subreddit, which specializes in those difficult cases. I recall using it successfully before, but it was before Sci-hub was a thing so I don’t have any particular advice on how to use it besides making you aware of its existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now living in an age where the obstacles between your curiosity and the resources with which to satisfy it are no more. Access to knowledge has, finally, been democratized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this post I showed you how you can access for free and without much hassle a vast and ever increasing vault filled to the brim with the knowledge that scientists the world over have labored to unlock. There has never been this much information about the world so widely available and for so many people to enjoy, and it is my sincere hope that this will help you in taking advantage of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to see what you choose to learn with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Alexey Guzey for reading a draft of this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
