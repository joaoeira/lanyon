Where would you be in life if you did not forget?

You would have done better in school, for starters. Instead of turning in your bed unable to sleep terrified of the exam coming the next day, you would soundly sleep with the knowledge that you know everything you need to know to ace the exam. And ace it you would indeed.

You would have spent fewer hours studying. How many times have you opened the textbook only to find that you’ve forgotten all that you’d studied the day before? If you did not forget things then those hours you spent studying would always amount to something, instead of leaving you feeling like you’re swimming against the current. School might even have been fun if you did not forget. 

What would your career look like if you did not forget? 

Forgetfulness affects us all. There is no one that has not grappled with this problem before. Our lives would be better if we did not forget. 

Unfortunately, forgetting is inescapable. There is no such thing as a perfect memory. I am not here to sell you on a magic pill that will turn you into Bradley Cooper in the movie Limitless.

However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t things you can do to massively reduce the speed at which you forget things, because there are. 

Science has known about what it takes to get memories to stick around in your memory for a long time. It has known about it for a while now, in fact. It’s just that it has done a terrible job so far at making sure that you know about it, you whose life would massively benefit from that knowledge.

My intent for writing this is to correct these wrongs and introduce you to spaced repetition, the more than established method that will put you in control of your memory once and for all, and Anki, the software that will help you do so. 

So, let’s start at the beginning: What is spaced repetition?

<!--more-->

## The Centuries Old Science They Don’t Tell You About

More than a hundred years ago, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus not only started the scientific study of memory, but he also made its most impactful discovery. 

After all, what discovery could be more impactful than what makes memories stick?

Ebbinghaus created various lists of nonsense syllables that he had to memorize, and once he was able to mouth off the entire list without making a single mistake he would mark on his calendar the day where he had to memorize that list once more. 

He would have to memorize some lists the day after, others a week and some a whole month after he had first memorized them. Doesn’t sound much fun, does it? This is especially true when you take into account each list must have taken him quite a long time to memorize since by design each of the three-letter syllables he had to study had been chosen so that they weren’t easily remembered. For example, the syllable BOL was out of the question as Ebbinghaus could instead use BALL to recall it. 

After the requisite time had passed, to measure the extent to which he had forgotten the list he’d spent so much time memorizing, he memorized the same list once more. Not only did he have to sit still in his office for a long time trying to memorize a bunch of nonsense words once, he had to do it twice! Throughout his second attempt he did have some help since it would take him less time to memorize the list the second time around if he remembered it from his first foray cramming it into his memory. 

If by that point he’d already forgotten it, then it would take him at least as much time to memorize the list the second time as it had the first. However, if some memory of it still lingered in the confines of his mind, he would be able to go through the list faster than before. By varying the amount of time between each attempt, and seeing how that influenced how long it took him then to memorize the list the second time, Ebbinghaus was able to measure the effect that time had on his memory.

And what an effect it had. 

{% include substack.html %}

The first thing he noticed was that memories are at their most fragile when they are still young. From the data he’d collected, he could see that the bulk of forgetting happens in the few moments after the memory is created. Rather than forgetting happening at a linear pace over time, each day that passes nicking a constant amount of the vitality of a memory until it is completely forgotten, Ebbinghaus discovered forgetting happens rather rapidly at first but slows down afterward. 

In the first few hours of its life, it’s as if your newly created memory has jumped out of a flying airplane and is now free-falling through the sky, the wind buffeting its face violently as it quickly loses altitude. As the ground becomes uncomfortably close, our memory activates its parachute and begins to glide, still falling, of course, but much slower than it was when it first jumped out of the plane. 
 
Now, to be sure, the forgetting curve, as this discovery came to be called, is an important landmark in the scientific study of memory, but it’s not a particularly useful one. We forget things over time; what a discovery! You don’t need to be a top-level scientist to come to that conclusion. It’s why we’re here in the first place!

![img](/assets/howtoneverforget_images/ForgettingCurve.png)

But Ebbinghaus didn’t stop there.
 
When he first started learning his lists of nonsense syllables, Ebbinghaus, like many a student, crammed all his studying in a single furious session. But then, possibly because he was fed up with all the cramming, he hit upon the idea of spreading his learning over time. Instead of spending the majority of a day learning one of his lists, he spaced out his learning over a few days. What he found when he did so is the most important discovery about memory that no one ever told you about.

You would think not much would change if instead of studying a bunch of material in one day you did so over three or more days. But what Ebbinghaus found was that not only did his memory got stronger, but it also took him less time to memorize his lists. This meant that simply by changing when he studied, Ebbinghaus could have the best of both worlds: a better memory with less time spent studying. 

It need not be pointed out how important a discovery this is. If someone came up to you and told you about a revolutionary studying method that would not only cut the time you spent studying but also get you to retain the things you learn for longer, you would think you were being sold on some sort of scam.

Yet the spacing effect, as Ebbinghaus’ discovery is called, is far from being a scam. It is one of the most scientifically supported discoveries in the entire field of psychology.

The gist of the spacing effect is rather simple. Given the choice between massing all your studying or spacing it out over a period of time, you are better served by spacing it out. There is no catch. It really is that simple. 

This means if you are a student and you have an exam coming up a month from now, you should start studying now rather than waiting until a single week is left. If, for example, you’re going to spend 50 hours studying, then spreading those hours over the whole month, ensuring that you get re-exposed to the material in sufficiently spaced intervals would get you much better results than you would if you crammed those 50 hours in a single stress-filled and coffee-fueled week. 

Of course, that’s easier said than done. 

The spacing effect is one of the most important weapons a learner can have on his arsenal but knowing about its amazing effects does not mean that we will necessarily apply it. After all, we all know not to eat too many processed foods do we not? Yet, that doesn’t seem to stop many of us. 

Pulling an all-nighter to cram for an exam is like binging on a sugar-filled pastry when one is trying to lose weight, yet the fact it continues to be a staple learning strategy of many a student is a testament to how difficult it can be to embrace the lessons of the spacing effect. 

If only there were an app for that...

## This App Will Turn Your Memory Into A Superpower

One hundred years ago Ebbinghaus didn’t have a computer, let alone a smartphone. If he’d had them they would have taken care of the task of spacing what he had to learn for. Instead, he had to do all of that himself, though if we consider that he was the kind of guy that did not balk at the idea of spending hundreds of hours learning endless lists of nonsense, perhaps he wasn’t that fazed by it.

Thankfully, we have tools that manage all of that for us today.

It all starts with a simple flashcard. 

Everyone knows how a flashcard is supposed to work. You write something on the front, then something on the back, and then you’re supposed to recall what it was that you wrote on the back after reading what’s on the front. 

Suppose that in the process of studying for a coming exam, you wrote many of these flashcards. You have a big pile of them sitting on your desk and within them are all the things you have to know if you want to ace the exam. 

Because you know about the spacing effect, you know that cramming those flashcards is a bad strategy, but then how are you supposed to space them out? There are so many cards to keep track of…

But what if those flashcards existed on your computer instead? 

If that were possible, then the computer could take care of the task of keeping track when you’re supposed to review your flashcards and you could focus solely on the things that matter, which, in this case, is answering your flashcards correctly and acing that exam. 

Which is why spaced repetition software was invented: to take care of all the grunt work so you can easily add spaced repetition into your life.

At its core, all spaced repetition software does is keep track of when to present you with the material that you put in it. It’s called spaced repetition software because they use special algorithms to calculate the optimal interval between when you last reviewed the material and when you’re supposed to review it again so you get all the benefits of the spacing effect. 

This might not seem much at first, but spaced repetition software is a revolutionary type of software and starting to use it is of the most impactful decisions you can make. Why?

Because spaced repetition software makes memory a choice. 

Think of it this way: forgetting is inescapable. The forgetting curve is a mean mistress and will pull all your memories down with it. However, the spacing effect tells us there are ways to weaken the forgetting curve’s pull and get memories to stay fresh in your mind for longer. What spaced repetition software does is to automate the job of tracking which memories have become weaker with time so that it can present them to you and thus, through the magical effects of the spacing effect, bring them back to life stronger than ever.

If the software deems one of your memories to still be strongly rooted within your mind, then it won’t show it the material. If it thinks instead that you’re about to forget the material it will put it in front of you for you to review. 

As long as you keep using the software, then anything and everything you put in it has the potential to become something that you remember forever.

Pretty nifty that, is it not?

So, which spaced repetition software should you use?

## A Gentle Introduction to Anki

If the title didn’t give it away, use Anki. 

There are many other kinds of spaced repetition software out there but you should use Anki. There’s a reason it’s the most popular spaced repetition software in the market. It has most of the features you will need and those it doesn’t are available as an add-on by the Anki community. 

Best of all, it’s free. 

To start using Anki, you will need to install it. You already know this of course, but it never hurts to start with the very basics. 

Once you’ve installed it, you will be presented with the following screen:

![img](/assets/howtoneverforget_images/HomeScreen.png)

This is the main Anki window and it shows the **Decks** you have in your collection. A Deck is just a group of cards. You can have as many decks as you want - although Anki struggles when you have a lot of them - but for most people, a single deck will suffice.

On the top menu above there is an Add button. Click on it. It’s time we create our first card. 

Once you click on the Add button, this window will appear:

![img](/assets/howtoneverforget_images/Note.png)

This is where Anki can become a bit confusing, but I will demystify it for you. 

Know that although Anki is a powerful piece of software, you can do without knowing most of its features and intricacies. You get the bulk of its benefits solely by using it, so you’re better off using it even when you do not understand how all of it works than never using it at all. As the saying goes, perfection is the enemy of good and for spaced repetition good is much better than none. 

The first thing to understand about how Anki works is that a **Card** - like the flashcards you already know about - is created from a **Note**. When you click the ‘Add’ button, the thing you’re adding is a Note, out from which one or more cards will be created by Anki. 

In the picture above, the Note I created has two **Fields**: **Front** and **Back**. 

The Front is where you put your question, and the Back is where you put, you guessed it, the answer to that question. It works very much like regular flashcards. You put questions on the Front and answers on the Back. 

Using an example from my Deck, here is a card that I added not too long ago:

*Front: Amygdala is Latin for what?*

*Back: Almond*

When Anki deems that it is time for me to review this card, it will show me *“Amygdala is Latin for what?” and I will have to answer, “Almond”. If you’re wondering why I added this to my collection, it’s because I was reading about the brain and I thought it interesting the amygdala is called that because it is shaped like an almond. I wanted to remember that interesting fact, so I added it to my Anki collection. Now I’ll never forget it. That’s the power of Anki; it puts your memory under your control.

Once you put your question and answer into Anki and click on the ‘Add’ button below, Anki will pick both the Front and Back fields and use them to create a card with the Front as the question and the Back as the answer. However, Anki will only create cards that way because it has been told to do so.

If you look back at the image above, there is a little option at the top titled **Type**. A **Note Type** dictates how many fields a note has and tells Anki how to use them to create cards. In our previous example, the **Basic** type dictates that a note has two fields, Front and Back, but you can create your own note types to suit your personal needs. 

By default, Anki comes with two note types installed: The Basic, which we’ve already met, and the Cloze. 

The Cloze note type was created with cloze deletion in mind. 

Cloze deletion, admittedly a rather strange name, is when a portion of a text is omitted, and you have to remember what fills in the blank. If instead of, “This is a cloze deletion” I wrote, “This is a ____ ______”, then it would be your job to fill in the blank with ‘cloze deletion’.

To create a card using the Cloze note type, click where it says Basic; this will open up a window showing all available types for you to choose from and select Cloze. You are now ready to create your first Cloze card.

![img](/assets/howtoneverforget_images/ThisIsAClozeNote.png)

Whereas before you had to add an answer and a question to create a card, for the Cloze type you merely have to tell Anki which portions of the text you want it to test you on. To do so, you need only select the portion of the text you want, go to the toolbar above, and select the fourth icon from the right, the one that looks like this [...].

In the image above, I selected two pieces of the text, “cloze note” and “two cards”. Anki, knowing that this card is of the Cloze type, will create two cards from this single note. The first card looks like this:

*This is a [...] that will create two cards*

Whereas the second one looks like this:

*This is a cloze note that will create [...]*

To answer these cards correctly I only need to fill in the blank. 

This is a [...] that will create two cards -> This is a cloze note that will create two cards

and

This is a cloze note that will create [...] -> This is a cloze note that will create two cards

The cloze type is very useful, as you can see. I recently used it to create four cards that test me on my knowledge of the brain’s anatomy. I wanted to learn the names of the four lobes of the brain, and to do so I created the following note:

    The four lobes of the brain are:
    {% raw %}
        - {{c4::Frontal}} lobe
        - {{c3::Parietal}} lobe
        - {{c2::Occipital}} lobe
        - {{c1::Temporal}} lobe 
    {% endraw %}

Anki created four cards from this single note, one for each lobe. When the time comes to review one of those cards, Anki will show me:

    The four lobes of the brain are:
        - Frontal lobe
        - Parietal lobe
        - Occipital lobe
        - [...] lobe

And I will have to answer: Temporal lobe.

It is unlikely you will ever have to create your own note types. The Basic and Cloze will cover most of your needs, and because perfection is the enemy of the good enough, trying to squeeze all efficiency out from Anki by creating your own hyper-specific types will only backfire when you find yourself not using Anki because it is too much work. 

Keep things simple and you won’t fall off. Remember, just using Anki is more than half the battle won. 

Now that you’ve added your first cards, it is time to review them. To do so, click on your deck in the decks’ list and then click on the Study Now button.

Because I created the cards I was showing you above, this is what appears:

![img](/assets/howtoneverforget_images/ThisIsAQuestion.png)

Now I need to try and remember what the answer to this is. Because this was just an example there’s no answer for me to remember, but if the question were to be, “Which spaced repetition software should you use?”, my task would have been to recall “Anki”.

When you have the answer in mind, or if you are incapable of recalling it, you click on the Show Answer button. 

As you probably figured out, Anki will show you the answer:

![img](/assets/howtoneverforget_images/AndThisIsAnAnswer.png)

Now comes the time for you to grade your memory.

In the image above, there are three options: Again, Good, and Easy. They are ordered by degree of difficulty in remembering the answer. 

If the memory has vanished entirely from your mind, then you select the Again button. That tells Anki that you need to spend more time with the material, and it will make sure to present it you sooner rather than later. 

On the other hand, if the answer came to you instantly, that means your memory of it is strong. By selecting the Easy button Anki will know that you likely do not need to review the material for a while. 

Here is one example of the options that appear in one of the cards I have to review today. 

![img](/assets/howtoneverforget_images/Grading.png)

As you can see, I have four options to choose from rather than the three above because I have already encountered this card many times before, whereas the card above was newly created. 

You may also notice that if I choose the Easy option, which I did because the answer to this particular card came to me instantly, then Anki will only show me once more approximately nine months from now. 

That is the power of the spacing effect combined with the magic of Anki in action.

What were the chances that 9 months from now I would remember I needed to review this question and see how well I remembered its answer?

None. There’s no way I would remember that, but with Anki, I don’t need to. It takes care of all of that for me. 

From calculating the optimal interval to showing it to us, Anki takes care of all the hard work of adopting spaced repetition into our lives. So long as we keep showing up for our daily reviews, Anki will make sure that we are in full control of our memory.

This means our number one priority should be to make sure we keep showing up for the daily review.

This is no small task. I have known about Anki and spaced repetition for close to a decade now, but it would be a stretch to say that I have been using it for that long. There have been many periods over the years where I have completely fallen off using it. It’s not that I forgot about Anki and the many benefits of spaced repetition - that would be ironic - but rather it is rather easy to fall into a trap where doing your daily reviews becomes a chore where you know that opening the program will bring little pleasure, and a whole lot of hurt.

This can happen for a variety of reasons. 

A common failure mode when starting out is to start throwing things willy-nilly at it in the hopes that Anki will somehow get it all into your thick head. For example, many people start out by adding all the capitals of the world. That sounds like a fun thing to memorize, right?

Yet eventually they find that they never really cared about it but now every day they’re being asked to come up with the capitals of countries, which they have no interest in doing, and they can’t answer it correctly exactly because they don’t care about it. Since they can’t answer the questions correctly, Anki keeps showing them the same boring questions over and over again in a vicious loop that quickly saps away all the fun there might be in learning cool stuff.

As I’ve said before and will continue to stress, the most important thing is to keep using Anki. Your priority, first and foremost, is to make sure that you stick with it. 

To that end, I have come up with a list of five tips that I believe will help make sure that Anki becomes a part of your life.

## 5 Tips to Help Turn Anki into a Habit That Will Change Your Life

### Use the mobile app

Pretty much everyone these days has a smartphone that can install apps. Anki has an app, so use it.

One of the cool things about Anki is that even though it is free, it still manages to offer a way for people to keep their collection synchronized across their many devices. That means any cards you add to your computer will get synced with your smartphone and if you do your daily review on your smartphone your computer will know that you have done so.

With the mobile app, you can do your daily views when you would otherwise have nothing else to do but aimlessly browse the web, which I am going to guess is plenty of time.

If instead of refreshing Twitter once more you instead spend the next ten minutes going through your daily review then at least those ten minutes will not have been the complete waste of time that they otherwise would have been - which is not to say that Twitter by necessity is a waste of time, as my piece on [how to use Twitter productively testifies](https://www.lettucebecereal.com/articles/usingtwitterasalearningengine).

Android users are in luck, as the AnkiDroid app is free. iOS users will have to spend some money to get the app, although that money directly supports the creator of Anki which is nice.

### Limit the number of cards you review per day

The algorithms that drive Anki’s choice of which cards you review each day were created with the goal of optimizing retention in mind. If the algorithm decides that today is the optimal day for you to review a card, then Anki will show it to you. 

But what if Anki decides today is the perfect day for you to review a thousand cards? That doesn’t seem that optimal to me.

Thankfully, by default Anki caps the number of cards it tells you to review to 150 cards per day, meaning that even if the algorithm decides that it would be best for you to review a thousand cards in a day, Anki will only show you 150 of them - you can afterward decide to review the remaining or stop there. 

My advice is to not mess too much with this cap. 

Some people in the Anki community advocate getting rid of the cap entirely. After all, if the all-mighty optimization algorithm says that you have to review a thousand cards, who are you to know better? 

Yet it seems to me that opening the Anki app to find out it will take you more than two hours to go through all the cards you have to review that day will only make it that much harder to open Anki the day after. Reviewing too many cards each day is a sure way to turn your daily review into a chore and that’s exactly what we’re looking to avoid.

Besides, even if you do not have that many cards to review on any given day, if for some unforeseen reason you miss doing your daily review, you still will have to go through those cards the day after along with any new ones that were already scheduled for that day. Each day that you miss means more cards added to the pile that you have to go through and anyone who has used Anki for a while will tell you that cards pile up faster than you expect. 

There is a reason why the official Anki documentation has a [special section](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/filtered-decks?id=catching-up) on how to deal with missed days.

By capping the number of cards you review per day you, might miss out on all the benefits of the algorithm, but it is better to use Anki imperfectly than to not use it perfectly. If attempting perfection means you drop out of using Anki, then you’re better off settling for good enough.

A slight aside: the reason why you might find people online telling you to get rid of the daily review cap is that a lot of medical students use Anki to cram the seemingly insurmountable mountain of knowledge that they need to cram into their heads. Removing the cap makes sense for medical students because they have a lot of things they need to get through and 150 cards a day is not nearly enough for that. However, the needs of medical students do not neatly translate to those of other people, so unless you’re a medical student, do not mess too much with the cap.

### Track the days you do your daily review
Because Anki expects you to do the daily reviews, well, daily, it is important when starting out to have a system that makes it easier to adopt the habit of opening up the app and go through your reviews daily instead of only opening it when it randomly crosses your mind.

Changing your habits, and adopting new ones, can be tough. That there are so many books and articles online about it is a testament to that. And while I can’t solve the problem of habit building once and for all, I can at least share what has worked for me to make Anki a part of my daily life. 

And that was to track the days where I went through my daily reviews.

As the saying goes, what gets tracked gets managed. If you keep a log of the days where you did your daily review, and hence the days where you did not, there will be no place for you to hide away from the fact that you are not doing something that you know you want to do. 

Tracking keeps you honest. That’s why calorie counting works: you can’t run from the fact that you just munched on an 800-calorie cheeseburger. 

There are many approaches and apps you can use to track your daily reviews. I use [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) when I want to track things in my life and the iOS app [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com/) also seems like a nice enough alternative. In the end, it doesn’t matter how you track this; you can use a small notebook that you carry with you every day: that’s how I track my meditation practice. What matters is that you track whether or not you have done your reviews for the day. 

### Be profligate about adding cards, but also in deleting them

There is a rush of adrenaline that comes with the realization that you’re finally the master of your memory. 

If you want to learn something and have it stay in memory rather than letting it flutter away as usual, now you can. Subjects that once you once thought insurmountable now seem doable. Topics that previously gave you a difficult time can finally be mastered. Old adversaries now crumble before your might!

Yet with that rush of excitement comes danger.

If things go well, you will use Anki for years on end, and if ten years from now you’re still using Anki, the cards that you add today will also appear to you then. Because of the expanding schedule inherent to the spacing effect and the algorithms that underlie Anki, when those cards appear to you ten years from now, they will do so after you not having seen them for potentially years.

A lot can happen in that time.

For starters, you may no longer care about those cards. Ten years from now, your interests may change. You will certainly have changed, but your cards didn’t. If you take up an interest in, say, the Roman mystery cults of the 1st century and add cards about them to your Anki collection, you will still encounter those same cards ten years from now. By then you might not even remember that you had such an interest, and you certainly might not care about any of those cards anymore.

Do you want to continue encountering those cards from years on end? Chances are you don’t. So, delete them.

Deleting cards might seem anathema to the apotheotic dream of remembering things forever, but the fact of the matter is that Anki exists to serve you, not the reverse. Again, the priority is in creating a system that gets you to do your daily reviews every day. If each time you open Anki the cards you have to review are about things you don’t care about, then you won’t be motivated to do your reviews. Deleting cards you don’t care about helps keep you motivated to do your daily reviews.

But there’s an even more important reason why you must not worship every card you create. 

And that is because, at least at first, your cards will suck.

Although it might not seem like it at first glance, creating good cards is a skill that you will need to develop. Because every card you create will continue appearing in your daily reviews so long as it continues in your collection, making sure that cards are created in such a way that you can answer them correctly and easily becomes of paramount importance. 

For instance, suppose you create the following card:

*Question: What are amino acids?*

*Answer: Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amine (–NH2) and carboxyl (–COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 naturally occurring amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be …*

You get the idea.

There is no way you’d be able to remember all of that in one go. 

To approach this particular piece of knowledge, you’d be better off by breaking things up into many cards, each containing a single thing that you need to recall. For example, you might add the following three cards:

*Question: What are the three components which together make up an amino acid?*

*Answer: A carboxyl group, an amino group, and the side chain*

*Question: Which four atomic elements are the key ingredients of an amino acid?*

*Answer: Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen*

*Question: How many amino acids are encoded by the DNA?*

*Answer: 20*

These cards contain the same core knowledge as the previous gigantic card, but because each one only asks for a specific, easy to handle, piece of knowledge, you will be much more successful at correctly answering them in your daily reviews.

The cost of having too many badly formulated cards in your collection is that you will have a much harder time answering them, which means that they will continuously appear in your daily reviews since your failure to answer them correctly makes Anki think that you need to go over them more regularly to get them to stick in your memory. 

But because they are bad cards, getting them into your memory will be quite a challenge. It will be like swimming against the current with a sack of rocks strapped to both your shins. You can swim as hard as you like, but there’s no escaping the current. 

What are you to do if - when - you find yourself with too many bad cards?

Well, first off, edit them. Your cards are not set in stone; you can modify them as you see fit. If there’s a way for you to separate that card into one, or more, simpler cards then that is a better alternative than letting the original bad card drag you down. 

You can also delete that card. Maybe you were a bit too trigger happy when your first added it and now that you’ve cooled off, you see that there’s nothing useful about having that card in your collection. It happens to the best of us. As I’ve said, once you realize you’re in control of your memory, learning becomes exhilarating, and all that excitement sometimes results in cards that are, shall we say, less than well thought-through. 

In any case, you will need to be proactive about managing the cards in your collection so you don’t find yourself in a situation where your daily reviews become a chore and bring you nothing of value. 

Add cards to your heart’s content, but do not be afraid of deleting them if that’s what’s needed.

In fact, you can do more than that. Create a deck filled with things that bring you nothing but joy. These can be inspirational quotes or art that you enjoy and that moves you. We’ll call this deck your joy deck. 

This joy deck is a bit different from your regular deck because rather than wanting the cards that you add to it to appear to you less and less, you want for them to continuously appear to you so that they can continue to give you that joie de vivre that led you to add them in your joy deck in the first place. 

Thankfully, because Anki is such a powerful piece of software, we can configure our joy deck to do just that. 

First off, create a new deck. You can call it Joy.

Click on the gearwheel that appears on the right and click on options. That will open a scary-looking window filled with lots of options for you to fiddle with. Worry not, we will only change a couple of things and you can forget about all the rest.

To the right of where it says ‘Options group’, click on the Manage button and select Add. This will create a new set of options that only applies to your Joy deck. We must do this because while we want the cards in our Joy deck to show up regularly, we do not want the same for our regular deck – otherwise, what’s the point, right?

You can name the new options group anything you want. I named mine Joy because that makes sense to me. 

Now that you have a new options group, you need only change two options:    

* ● In the Reviews tab, change the option where it says Maximum reviews/day to 20
* ● Again in the Reviews tab, change the Maximum interval to 15 days.

The names are self-explanatory. The first option tells Anki to only show 20 cards a day from your Joy deck - your joy cards, whereas the second tells it that you do not want to go more than 15 days without seeing each of your joy cards. 

Of course, you can change both these options to be more to your liking, but I think this is a nice starting point.

Here is an example from my Joy deck:

What, the menacing face of Jocko Willink doesn’t bring you joy? You’re such a weirdo…

The joy deck isn’t the only way you can use Anki to bring more joy into your life. For example, you can use it to remember things about your favorite fiction. Are you a Tolkien fan? You can add cards about it on your regular deck. 

You can also use Anki to enrich your relationships with the people in your life by adding details about them to it. For example, you can use it to memorize their birthdays or the foods they love. 

There exists no life that could not use more joy in it, so use Anki to bring some light to yours. 
Conclusion
Other than death and taxes, there likely isn’t any other ailment that affects as many people as forgetting. 

We have all struggled with at one time or another. 

For many of us, some of the most important decisions in our lives were conditioned on how good or bad our memories were. Right now, there are hundreds of students all around the globe cursing themselves because they keep forgetting things they need to know and the exam is approaching fast. 

The science of memory is unequivocal. While forgetting is inescapable, spacing our learning will help us finally get a handle on our memory and remember things for longer. 

Spaced repetition software, and Anki in particular, takes care of the logistics of spaced repetition so that we can focus on what matters, which is learning the material and doing the daily reviews that will keep that material in memory.

Making Anki a part of your life will likely be one of the most valuable decisions you can do in your life, and I hope this gentle introduction helps you take that step.
