I"£<p>We spend a large part of our lives reminiscing about the past.</p>

<p>Few activities are as quintessentially human as being on the cusp of falling asleep and suddenly be assaulted by a memory that has us relive an embarrassing episode that we thought long forgotten.  Yet this ability to store and recall the past didnâ€™t emerge so that we could cringe at our past ineptness. We use our memories all the time, from remembering where we parked our car, to cook todayâ€™s dinner, or to try and put a name to the face of the person whoâ€™s now talking to us as if weâ€™d met before, even though we could swear up and down to never have seen that person before.</p>

<p>Our memory is a crucial aspect of our cognition, and we often bemoan when it fails us. Ask the student who failed an exam, or the husband who forgot to buy his wife a gift for her birthday and now finds himself having to sleep on the couch in repentance.</p>
